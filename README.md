FreeCodeCamp has helped me stay sharp with my programming fundamentals and pick up new tricks along the way. This repo is just a collection of the labs Iâ€™ve completed so far â€” Iâ€™m always on there working through new ones and finding ways to level up as a programmer.

I like using these projects as a way to test what Iâ€™ve learned, try new things, and just keep my skills fresh.

ðŸ’¡ Whatâ€™s Inside

A bunch of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS labs

Each one built to sharpen my logic and problem-solving

Updated whenever I finish something new

âš¡ Why I Keep Doing It

Because staying consistent beats being perfect. Every lab pushes me a little further â€” and thatâ€™s what itâ€™s all about.

Always building. Always improving.
